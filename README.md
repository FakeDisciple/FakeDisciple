- 👋 Hi, I’m @FakeDisciple
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Data Scientist, with a long term goal of becoming a Machine Learning Speacialist
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a Data Scientist. I would apply for jobs now but due to the pandemic I feel like I didn't learn the essentials and I am taking time to learn to become a Jr. Data Scientist.
